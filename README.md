# WunderWasser

A haptic simulation of fluid dynamics principles for engineering students. Uses the Haply linkage and Hapkit paddle to allow users to explore a virtual fluid environment, based on common environments investigated with the Navier-Stokes equations, such as parallel plates and a cylindrical pipe.
